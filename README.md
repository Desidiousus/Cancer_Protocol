LEGAL NOTICE: THIS IS NOT ADVERTISED AS A CURE FOR CANCER, AS I AM NOT A MEDICAL PROFESSIONAL. A potentially viable way to suffocate cancer cells from their energy source, thus causing them to self-destruct.  All cancer cells, regardless of type, have damaged mitochondria and can no longer respirate O2. Thus the cancer cells switch to an ancient  process of fermentation which allows them to survive on glycogen and glutamine. (sugar)
